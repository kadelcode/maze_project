# SDL2 Library & Raycasting
- SDL(Simple DirectMedia Layer) library is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, joystick, mouse and graphics hardware via OpenGL, Direct3D.
- Raycasting is a simple technique used in computer graphics to render 3D scenes.
